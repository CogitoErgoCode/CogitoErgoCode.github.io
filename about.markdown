## **A Brief Summary**

My name is Ryan and I am a self-taught computer programmer, and life long autodidact. I enjoy cultivating a healthy balance between mind and body. My lifestyle consists of hiking, calisthenics, and combat sports. I also keep my mind active with logic puzzles, computer programming, information security, cryptocurrencies, business, investing, economics, the piano, and [language learning](https://invite.duolingo.com/BDHTZTB5CWWKSXYMDKXA7KAG64). I also enjoy cooking as a hobby.

## **Past, Present, & Future**

In economic or game theory, a [zero-sum game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game) is an instance where for every winner there is a loser or group of losers. If you subtract the losses from all the gains you end up with zero. In order to increase the likelihood of long-term monetary success, it would be beneficial to avoid speculation except for small percentages of capital. Non-speculative investments exist, and once in a life time opportunities happen every year. 

# Throughout time I've always set goals

- `Physical:` In my youth, I was heavily inspired by [Bruce Lee](https://youtu.be/cJMwBwFj5nQ) and his hybrid fighting philosophy 截拳道 (Jeet Kune Do "Way of the Intercepting Fist"). Chinese martial arts (武術; wǔshù) and classical eastern philosophy were among my first and deepest influences as a child. In my adolescence I attended one of the major modern Okinawan martial arts called [Shōrin-ryū](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Drin-ry%C5%AB) (少林流). It was likely this experience that filled me with such great discipline as well as an admiration for Japanese culture. I continued training myself with calisthenics until, by the time I was a young man, I was able to reach *31 chin-ups consecutively* (from a dead hang while fully extended each time). For comparison, I had surpassed the highest repetition count for pull-ups In the Marine Corps PFT (23) on my own.

- `Technical:` Inspired by a grey hat named 'Tempest' who I met in the IRC & MSN chatrooms decades ago, I adopted the philosophy of *autodidacticism* and taught myself how to program in C/C++, grew advanced with Perl, but ultimately my formal language of choice became Python, and as a result, the predominant paradigm you'll see me implement in this blog is of the imperative (procedural & object-oriented) rather than declarative variety. 

- `Linguistic:` According to the [telescope rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language) it takes less time to first learn a simple constructed language and then a natural language, than to learn only a natural language. According to the University of Manchester, the [propaedeutic value of Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaedeutic_value_of_Esperanto) raises language awareness and accelerates subsequent learning of foreign languages. As an aspiring Esperantist, I intend to utilize the constructed language [Esperanto (Mi deziras paroli Esperanton flue)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto) as a [neural ramp](https://youtu.be/GWSZ1DKjNzY) or springboard to better understand natural languages. See the **Natural Language** section below. 

<!-- Mi lernas Esperanton -->

<!-- like [German (Ich lerne Deutsch)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language) & [Japanese (私は日本語を勉強しています)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language). -->

<!-- I am curious about golang and interested in C# and Unity 2D indie game development. -->

<!-- *One of my command-line tools was even featured in BlackArch linux operating system and remains a part of their tool list to this day.* -->

- `Artistic:` My latest hobby, and preferred way to relax, is to play music on my piano. I've recently purchased a Yamaha P-125 88-key portable digital piano to replace the cheap keyboard I was previously using. Eventually, when I become sufficiently advanced years down the road, I'll likely upgrade to something like a [Nord Stage 3](https://www.sweetwater.com/insync/best-88-key-digital-pianos/). I am currently writing & illustrating a book with what little spare time I have left.

- `Financial` 

    - [`Triumph:`](https://poets.org/poem/if) Some years ago, I started reading books on business and investing. It wasn't until I found ["Rich Dad Poor Dad" by Robert Kiyosaki](http://library.lol/main/FA913718EA4585DC4282D5E51ABD3DC2) that I formed my first idea. I was inspired to invest, and as fate would have it, a long time friend of mine was looking to invest in me. Being tech savvy I had dabbled with cryptocurrencies years before, but never paid it too much attention, never caring much about money or material possessions. With my newfound interest I managed my investors money and bought into crypto right before it skyrocketed. *Return on investment was 617.241%, and between two interested parties we made 6 figures in a month.* This was my first attempt & success at the right side of the cash flow quadrant.

    - [`Disasters:`](https://poets.org/poem/if) Many. My current goal is to achieve financial freedom by acting upon a few business ideas.. It is my desire to learn how to better mitigate risk, and how to become a transaction engineer. I've only just begun to apply the things in which I have learned.
    
    <!-- Not to long ago an investment I had waited on for a long time made a 4,483.44% increase and near 7-figure sum according to how much I had intended to invest. I straight up didn't see the silent release... As you might imagine, I was less than enthused. I'm not discouraged however, this is validation that my ideas and thinking are correct. -->

<!-- Social Security (Ponzi Scheme), just like welfare, is an entitlement. -->

<!-- - `Disaster:` Not to long ago an investment I had waited on for a long time made a 4,483.44% increase and near 7-figure sum according to how much I had intended to invest. As you might imagine, I was less than enthused.

- `Disaster:` 6-figure rugpull. -_- -->

<!-- - `Literary:` It's also worth mentioning that I've been collecting material to write & illustrate a novel in one of the subgenres of fantasy. -->

## **Musical, Literary, & Artistic Influences**

<!-- In my youth I grew up admiring both the piano and violin, I think it's somewhat unfortunate that I allowed so much time to pass without exploring these instruments and developing a lifelong skill. Now that I'm older I find myself still curious about what I might have accomplished had I committed to either of these beautiful instruments.

The violin likely holds the title for [most difficult instrument](https://www.guitarlobby.com/hardest-instruments-to-play/), at least when compared to the guitar and piano. The fact that it's a fretless stringed instrument is the main reason I can think of. You can think of frets like you might think of training wheels. Frets are there to guide your fingers into their proper placement, and with the violin this aid does not exist traditionally, causing one to memorize the exact placement of ones fingers on the neck to produce a specific tone. -->

<!-- The piano likely takes the second spot in difficulty when compared to the violin and guitar. The main reason I can think of is the ambidextrous nature having to coordinate and synchronize each hand while they play completely different things. Pianists also make use of pedals so they make use of their feet as well. -->

# Classical / Neoclassical Piano

The Mozart Effect, and exposure to classical music having a beneficial effect on mental development, is said to be a myth. If that were so, why then do patients with epilepsy find a decrease in epileptiform activity while listening to Mozart's K.448 and Piano Concerto No. 23 (K. 488)? Tempo, structure, melodic and harmonic consonance and predictability are said to be the reason. I realize that correlation does not always equal causation, but I prefer to believe it. Perhaps this is because I have a bias for the piano, having grown up admiring it.

I think it's important to have a basic understanding of general physics & chemistry to better understand how the universe operates.

## **Natural Language**

The [Sapir–Whorf hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity), or Whorfianism, suggests that language affects our world views and perceptions, relative to ones native language. I've always wondered how my thoughts and influences might change if I became multilingual. Another thought was whether or not programming languages and musical languages, if you will, had any impact on this theory.

> “Once you stop learning you start dying” &mdash; Albert Einstein

The [Foreign Service Institute (FSI)](https://www.state.gov/foreign-language-training/) of the U.S. Department of State compiled learning expectations for the amount of time it takes a native english speaker to achieve proficiency with any given language. Languages are divided by difficulty into Categories I-IV. I have often considered taking on the challege of learning 1 language from each category.

<!-- > “Time is the longest distance between two places.” &mdash; Tennessee Williams, The Glass Menagerie -->

<!-- Everything Category I and beyond is from the FSI. I'm modifying the table with a new category to represent constructed languages. We'll call it Category 0, since in computer science array indices start with zero. -->

<!-- - `Category 0:` (150 class hours)
    - **Esperanto** -->

- `Category I (Easy):` 24 weeks (600-750 class hours)
    - Danish, Dutch, 🇫🇷 **French (30 weeks)**, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish 
- `Category II (Moderate):` Approximately 36 weeks (900 class hours)
    - 🇩🇪 **German**, Haitian Creole, Indonesian, Malay, Swahili
- `Category III (Hard):` Approximately 44 weeks (1100 class hours)
    - Albanian, Amharic, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Bengali, Bulgarian, Burmese, Czech, Dari, Estonian, Farsi, Finnish, Georgian, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Icelandic, Kazakh, Khmer, Kurdish, Kyrgyz, Lao, Latvian, Lithuanian, Macedonian, Mongolian, Nepali, Polish, Russian, Serbo-Croatian, Sinhala, Slovak, Slovenian, Somali, Tagalog, Tajiki, Tamil, Telugu, Thai, Tibetan, Turkish, Turkmen, Ukrainian, Urdu, Uzbek, Vietnamese
- `Category IV (Super Hard):` 88 weeks (2200 class hours)
    - Arabic, Cantonese (Chinese), Mandarin (Chinese), 🇯🇵 **Japanese**, Korean

<!-- **I have not commited to any natural language for more than a month** consecutively, in my lifetime, thus far; however, by observing my learning habits, I seem to gravitate toward Germanic languages.  -->

I have put a considerable amount of thought behind what the criteria would be for selecting a language while ensuring its practicality:

1. [The language should have a high population of speakers. (frequency)](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/a-world-of-languages/)
2. [The language should be in the top 10 wealthiest nations. (longevity)](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/all-of-the-worlds-wealth-in-one-visualization/)
3. The language should be part of a culture you identify with. (enjoyment)

I have often thought of learning more about the ancient past and [old world languages](/assets/images/oldworld.jpg). [Old Norse](https://youtu.be/_ASsCH17cbA) is fascinating, with Icelandic being the most conservative of the North Germanic languages. It's unlikely I'll ever study this, but I thought it worth a mention.

According to a preliminary study, Esperanto led to a **50% improvement in French** langugage acquisition, 40% in English, **30% in German**, and 25% in Russian. If we look at French we can see that learning esperanto first reduces the amount of time from 750 hours to 375 hours (a difference of 375 hours). German is also cut down from 900 hours to 630 hours (a difference of 270 hours). Together that's 645 hours saved, roughly the size of an enitre language, because of Esperanto.

It's interesting to note that Esperanto can be learned in 150 hours. If we look at the amount of hours left in French, after accounting for the preliminary study, we find that 150 hours of Esperanto + 375 hours of French = 525 hours total. That's 2 languages in 225 hours less than French alone (750 hours).

I will likely focus on **Esperanto** first because of its [propaedeutic value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaedeutic_value_of_Esperanto) which raises language awareness and accelerates subsequent learning of foreign languages, **followed by the languages in bold above**. Esperanto will serve as a [neural ramp](https://youtu.be/GWSZ1DKjNzY) to the rest.

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.” &mdash; Theodore Roosevelt
