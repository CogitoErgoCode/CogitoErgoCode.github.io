I've created a few lists of recommended reading below, I hope you find them as edifying as I have.

<!-- I hope you derive as much pleasure from reading them as I have.  -->

<!-- You must have a serene state of mind, tranquil like water after a storm. You must yield and overcome, bend and become straight, empty your mind to be filled, wear out to be renewed. Soon you will have forgotten all things, and soon all things will have forgotten you. -->

## üßÆ Science & Mathematics

## üìú Wisdom & Philosophy

<!-- Recent revelatory epiphanies I‚Äôve been attempting to enact. These number among the most difficult things a man can subdue unto himself. It‚Äôs easy to live a life of epicureanism, but a true test of inner strength is to imbue one‚Äôs soul with stoic equanimity. While my beliefs rest in Christ, my philosophy is not blind to... keep in mind that belief and philosophy are separate. -->

The word philosophy comes from the Greek word philosophia (œÜŒπŒªŒøœÉŒøœÜŒØŒ±), which means 'love of wisdom'. I've found [equanimity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equanimity) to be a reoccurring theme in the philosophies I gravitate towards. According to the Greek Stoics, [apatheia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apatheia) was the quality that characterized the sage. The Roman Stoics called it [aequanimitas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equanimity). 

<!-- In Philosophical Taoism, equanimity is the practice and the effect of that practice. Equanimity is considered essential for carrying out the theological virtues (Aretƒì). -->

<!-- While I have only one belief in Christ, in accordance with the law of non-contradiction, I have many philosophies.  -->

 

<!-- And so, it is not, but the appreciation of equanimity. -->

<!-- > Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence [[Aretƒì]](https://biblehub.com/greek/703.htm), if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. &mdash; Philippians 4:8 -->

<!-- 
2 Peter 1:3
2 Peter 1:5 -->

<!-- For many years, I have made an effort to collect philosophies bearing resemblance to the ultimate truth. A truth I believe is written on the hearts of men. -->

<!-- > Even Gentiles, who do not have God‚Äôs written law, show that they know his law when they instinctively obey it, even without having heard it. They demonstrate that God‚Äôs law is written in their hearts, for their own conscience and thoughts either accuse them or tell them they are doing right. &mdash; Romans 2:14-15 -->

<!-- Understand that there is a distinction between what a man believes as his faith and healthy philosophies.  -->

<!-- > ‚ÄúHow much time he gains who does not look to see what his neighbour says or does or thinks, but only at what he does himself, to make it just and holy.‚Äù &mdash; Emperor Marcus Aurelius, Meditations  -->

## üó£Ô∏è Inspirational Quotes

> ‚ÄúIt is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.‚Äù &mdash; Aristotle, Metaphysics

> ‚ÄúIt is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.‚Äù &mdash; Theodore Roosevelt

<!-- > "To be nobody but
yourself in a world
which is doing its best day and night to make you like
everybody else means to fight the hardest battle
which any human being can fight and never stop fighting." &mdash; E.E. Cummings -->

<!-- > "Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle.

"If somebody graduated from a great university, that may be an indication that they will be capable of great things, but it's not necessarily the case.
