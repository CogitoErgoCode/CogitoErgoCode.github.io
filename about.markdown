I like to teach myself things and blog about it. I've created a few lists of recommended reading below. My full bio can be read [here](https://cogitoergocode.github.io/bio/). If you'd like to follow my language learning progress, I would encourage you to follow me on <a href="https://invite.duolingo.com/BDHTZTB5CWWKSXYMDKXA7KAG64" style="color:#0073e6;">DuoLingo</a>.
