## **Extracting Data From Binance.US**

We need to create an account somewhere that will allow us API access to the data we need to feed to our python program. It's been awhile since I've used a centralized exchange so let's walk through this process together.

Let's register with the United States based [Binance.US](https://accounts.binance.us/en/register) exchange. Once you've completed the registration. Navigate to the [API Management](https://www.binance.us/en/usercenter/settings/api-management) page. Follow the prompts until you've been presented with your `API key` and `Secret Key`. You'll likely want to keep these safeguarded in a password database like [KeyPassXC](https://keepassxc.org/).

## Directory Structure

Create the following directory structure.

```
crypto/
├─ analysis/
│  ├─ __init__.py
│  ├─ ichimoku.py
│  ├─ macd.py
│  ├─ moving.py
│  ├─ rsi.py
│  └─ williams.py
├─ binance/
│  ├─ __init__.py
│  ├─ api.py

│  └─ market.py
└─ main.py
```

## **Exploring The Binance.US API**

```
crypto/
└─ binance/
   └─ api.py
       Ⓒ BinanceAPI()
          Ⓢ error_handler()
          Ⓢ deserialize()
```

We will be making heavy use of the [Binance.US API Documentation](https://docs.binance.us/). 

- The base endpoint is: **https://api.binance.us** 
- All endpoints return either a JSON object or array. 
- Data is returned in ascending order. Oldest first, newest last. 
- All time and timestamp related fields are in milliseconds.

```py
from requests.exceptions import HTTPError
from functools           import wraps

class BinanceAPI:

    API_KEY    = "YOUR API KEY GOES HERE"
    API_SECRET = "YOUR API SECERT GOES HERE"
    HEADER     = {
        'get' : {"X-MBX-APIKEY": API_KEY},
    }

    # Base + Version
    __baseEndpoint = 'https://api.binance.us'
    ENDPOINT       = __baseEndpoint + '/api/v3/'
    
    @staticmethod
    def error_handler(func):
        @wraps(func)
        def logic(*args, **kwargs):
            resp = func(*args, **kwargs)
            
            if not resp.ok:
                raise HTTPError(f"[!] Error: {resp.status_code} {resp.reason} {resp.json()}")
                
            if resp.status_code != 200:
                print(f"[!] Warning: {resp.status_code} {resp.reason}")
            
            return resp
        return logic
    
    @staticmethod
    def deserialize(func):
        @wraps(func)
        def transform(*args, **kwargs):
            try:
                resp = func(*args, **kwargs)
            except HTTPError as error:
                print(error)
                return False

            return resp.json()
        return transform
```

## The BinanceAPI Method Decorators

The `@error_handler` decorator is a simple function that tests the response object for an HTTP status code of 400 or higher, indicated by the negation of resp.ok. If this is triggered the decorator will raise requests.exception.HTTPError with the response objects textual reason as the error. You can expand this on your own with resp.status_code.

```py
@staticmethod
def error_handler(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def logic(*args, **kwargs):
        resp = func(*args, **kwargs)
        
        if not resp.ok:
            raise HTTPError(f"[!] Error: {resp.status_code} {resp.reason} {resp.json()}")
            
        if resp.status_code != 200:
            print(f"[!] Warning: {resp.status_code} {resp.reason}")
        
        return resp
    return logic
```

The final decorator we will be making use of is our deserializer. Essentially this function will handle the result of the previous decorator as we will be stacking these decorators over the various class methods. If the `@error_handler` decorator raises an exception, the try except block will be executed, returning `False`. If all goes as planned, the requests response object is passed into the `@deserialize` decorator, which will take an stringified json object from the server and "deserialize" it into a dictionary object manipulatable by our program.

```py
@staticmethod
def deserialize(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def transform(*args, **kwargs):
        try:
            resp = func(*args, **kwargs)
        except HTTPError as error:
            print(error)
            return False

        return resp.json()
    return transform
```

## Extracting Candlestick Data

```
crypto/
└─ binance/
   └─ market.py
        Ⓒ MarketData(BinanceAPI)
            Ⓜ klines()
```

The primary role this class plays is that of the retrieval of actionable data from the Binance.US REST server. Through inheritance of its parent BinanceAPI class, each method’s returned data will be deserialized into useable data structures for use in our bot.

- For GET endpoints, parameters must be sent as a query string.
- [Candlestick Kline Documentation](https://docs.binance.us/?python#get-candlestick-data)

```py
from binance.api import BinanceAPI

class MarketData(BinanceAPI):
    
    @BinanceAPI.deserialize
    @BinanceAPI.error_handler
    def ping(self):
        """

<!-- {:height="400px" width="400px"} -->

The best settings for moving averages are: 10, 50, 100, 200. 

- A **`Golden Cross`** entry signal transpires when a fast and low moving average `closes above` a slow and higher moving average. Alternatively, `closing below` a slower MA is bearish. For instance, when the 50 breaks above the 200, this signals the start of a bullish trend.

- A **`Death Cross`** is when a slow higher moving average `closes above` a fast lower moving average. Alternatively, `closing below` a faster MA is Bullish. For instance, when the 50 breaks below the 200, this signals the start of a bearish trend.

- **`Entry Strategy`**: Using both of William's indicators concurrently yields the best results. When the 5 crosses above both the 8 and 13, that is your signal to look for longs. You can enter right then, or more safely, when the price breaches above the nearest bearish green upward pointing fractal, this is your entry.

- **`Exit Strategy`**: The best thing to use fractals for are stop losses. It is a simple affair to set a stop loss on every `bullish fractal` that appears after making your entry. These are the red downwards pointing triangles. If the price closes below the red, middle, or 8 SMMA; this can also be used as a stop loss, much like the bullish red downwards pointing fractals. We're not looking at wicks here, only candle closes.

The Ichimoku Kinko Hyo indicator, better known as `Ichimoku cloud`, is best when used for trend determination, entry signals, exit signal, re-entry signals. Do not use when the market is clearly trend less and sideways. In these instances, use Bollinger Bands or Chart Patterns instead. The best settings for Ichimoku Cloud are as follows

<!-- - Default: 9 / 26 / 52 / 26 / 26
- Crypto: 10 / 30 / 60 / 30 / 30
- Double: 20 / 60 / 120 / 30 / 30 -->

- `Altcoins`: According to a [reliable source](https://medium.com/@CarpeNoctom/toshimokus-trading-tips-tricks-f0ff5cc38cc8), for altcoins, backtesting has shown that on the 1D time frame, 10/30/60/30 gives a superior entry and exit signal compared to the doubled settings. The altcoin markets are more explosive relative to the more stable Bitcoin market, which has a larger market capitalization.

- `Bitcoin`: The doubled settings are best for most all other cases, and are the setting I used the most. If you are looking at the 1h time frame you're looking at the 2h cloud. If you look at the 4h time frame, you're looking at the 8h cloud. This decreases the false positives and increases the profitable trades you take. 

|Entry Signals||
|:-:|:-:|
|Trend|Is the price above or below the **Cloud**? This is the Gold Standard in determining whether or not the current market state is bullish or bearish.|
|Future|Is the **Cloud** bullish or bearish? Pay attention to the **Kumo twist**.|
|TK Cross|Has the **Tenkan** crossed above the **Kijun**? This is very similar to EMA crosses.|
|Fence|If you're on the fence about what to do, check the **Chikou** Lagging Span position. Is the Chikou above or below the **Price** and/or **Cloud**. Can save you from taking a suboptimal position, especially when price is essentially sideways.|

The RSI is considered a **momentum indicator** which means that it’s used to determine the speed and strength of price movement and whether the underlying momentum is strengthening or weakening. RSI is also used to identify overbought and oversold conditions, as well as divergence and hidden divergence signals. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph that fluctuates between two extremes) and oscillates between 0 and 100.

- Readings over 50 indicate that price movement rising
- Readings below 50 indicate that price movement is falling

The RSI is considered Oversold when below 30 and Overbought when above 70 so there are three primary “areas” to consider:

- Readings 0-30 indicate an **Oversold** position
- Readings 70-100 indicate an **Overbought** position

MACD is an acronym for Moving Average Convergence Divergence, and is a trend following momentum oscillator. The MACD is the red line in the chart, while the blue like is the signal line.

- MACD crossing above zero is bullish
- MACD crossing below zero is bearish
- MACD crossing above the signal line is bullish (the further below the zero, the stronger the signal)
- MACD crossing below the signal line is bearish (the further above the zero, the stronger the signal)
- The Histogram is the difference between the MACD and signal line (may give you an early sign that a crossover is about to happen)
- MACD is also used for spotting divergences like RSI
