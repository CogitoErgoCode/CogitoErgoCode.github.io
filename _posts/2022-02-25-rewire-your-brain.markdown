This is going to be a lite article on techniques that stimulate and accelerate the learning process. I'm writing it to organize my thoughts on the things that I've found to work in my autodidactism, before I begin my next big undertaking. Hopefully, you'll find the information useful.

## **Amplifying Neuroplasticity**

# How to Grow Your Brain

Recreational mathematics like logic puzzles, and strategy board games like chess have been shown to increase neuroplasticity. Obviously programming, mathematics, and physics would be extremely beneficial.

# The Corpus Callosum

Additionally, The Mozart effect is also interesting to note: patients with epilepsy find a decrease in epileptiform activity while listening to Mozart's K.448 and Piano Concerto No. 23 (K. 488). Tempo, structure, melodic and harmonic consonance and predictability are said to be the reason.

- Learning a second language can increase problem solving ability. 
- The [Sapir‚ÄìWhorf hypothesis](https://www.youtube.com/embed/RKK7wGAYP6k), or Whorfianism, suggests that language affects our world views and perceptions, relative to ones native language. 

## **Study Techniques**

# Active Recall

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ukLnPbIffxE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<br>
Reading and studying are two very different things, and of those things which compose proper study, active recall reigns supreme. Best when used in combination with interleaved practice, the Feynman technique, and spaced repetition. 

# The Feynman Technique

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tkm0TNFzIeg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This blog essentially acts as an expression of this technique.

> "If you want to master something, teach it. The more you teach, the better you learn. Teaching is a powerful tool to learning." &mdash; Richard P. Feynman [(The Feynman Technique)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_Technique)

<!-- > I don't know what's the matter with people: they don't learn by understanding; they learn by some other way - by rote, or something. Their knowledge is so fragile! &mdash; Richard P. Feynman -->

# Interleaved Practice

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J-O5Y3TwrUk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

`random.shuffle(x)`

# Spaced Repetition - Negation Of The Forgetting Curve

# The Telescope Rule

According to the [telescope rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language) it takes less time to first learn a simple constructed language and then a natural language, than to learn only a natural language. According to the University of Manchester, the [propaedeutic value of Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaedeutic_value_of_Esperanto) raises language awareness and accelerates subsequent learning of foreign languages. 

> "Thomson's Rule for First-Time Telescope Makers: "It is faster to make a four-inch mirror then a six-inch mirror than to make a six-inch mirror." &mdash; Programming Pearls, Communications of the ACM, September 1985

<!-- As an aspiring Esperantist, I intend to utilize the constructed language <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto" style="color:#0073e6;">Esperanto</a> as a <a href="https://youtu.be/GWSZ1DKjNzY" style="color:#0073e6;">neural ramp</a> or springboard to better understand natural languages. -->

The [Foreign Service Institute (FSI)](https://www.state.gov/foreign-language-training/) of the U.S. Department of State compiled learning expectations for the amount of time it takes a native english speaker to achieve proficiency with any given language. Languages are divided by difficulty into Categories I-IV.

|||
|:-:|:-:|
|Category I (Easy)<br>24-30 weeks (600-750 class hours)|Danish, Dutch, **French (30)**, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Romanian, **Spanish**, Swedish|
|Category II (Moderate)<br>Approximately 36 weeks (900 class hours)|**German**, Haitian Creole, Indonesian, Malay, Swahili|
|Category III (Hard)<br>Approximately 44 weeks (1100 class hours)|Albanian, Amharic, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Bengali, Bulgarian, Burmese, Czech, Dari, Estonian, Farsi, Finnish, Georgian, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Icelandic, Kazakh, Khmer, Kurdish, Kyrgyz, Lao, Latvian, Lithuanian, Macedonian, Mongolian, Nepali, Polish, **Russian**, Serbo-Croatian, Sinhala, Slovak, Slovenian, Somali, Tagalog, Tajiki, Tamil, Telugu, Thai, Tibetan, Turkish, Turkmen, Ukrainian, Urdu, Uzbek, Vietnamese|
|Category IV (Super Hard)<br>88 weeks (2200 class hours)|Arabic, Cantonese (Chinese), Mandarin (Chinese), **Japanese**, Korean|

According to a preliminary study, Esperanto led to a **50% improvement in French** language acquisition, 40% in English, **30% in German**, and 25% in Russian. If we look at French we can see that learning Esperanto first reduces the amount of time from 750 hours to 375 hours (a difference of 375 hours). German is also cut down from 900 hours to 630 hours (a difference of 270 hours). Together that's 645 hours saved, roughly the size of an enitre language, because of Esperanto.

It's interesting to note that Esperanto can be learned in 150 hours. If we look at the amount of hours left in French, after accounting for the preliminary study, we find that 150 hours of Esperanto + 375 hours of French = 525 hours total. That's 2 languages in 225 hours less than French alone (750 hours).

## **Productivity Enhancement**

# Time Management

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IUXNiDJJ_9s" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

When you do come back to your studies from spaced repetition, use one of the following time management techniques:
- The Pomodoro Technique
    - 25/5 x 4 then 30m break
- 90-Minute Method (Ultradian Rhythm)
    - 90 or 120 minutes of study
    - Break for 20 minutes
- 52/17 Method

# Video Speed Controller

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/chiKi95j9UM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

I usually set my audiobooks on youtube around the suggested 2.65x. In the past couple of weeks I've read over 22 books thanks to this little trick I've been employing on youtube.

## PDF To Speech üí¨

What article on a coding blog would be complete without actual code right. Video Speed Controller had been so useful that I got to thinking, that it would be nice if I had the same capability with some of my PDFs, as most of my library is composed of hundreds of PDFs.

‚ö†Ô∏è PyPDF library does not work with all PDFs!

>  This works **well for some** PDF files, but **poorly for others**... &mdash; [extractText()](https://pythonhosted.org/PyPDF2/PageObject.html#PyPDF2.pdf.PageObject.extractText)

I am comically annoyed at my first attempt, mostly because I programmed it only to find out that the underlying library only extracts texts well, from *"some"* PDFs. Anyhow, I'll share what I have, it does work for *"some"* PDFs afterall.

<!-- While the program below is functional, I'm looking for a solution in a different library that will support all PDFs. If you have any suggestions feel free to contact my email. Any code examples you provide will be credited to you in future sections. -->

# The Main Program

|:-:|:-:|
|[PyPDF Documentation](https://pythonhosted.org/PyPDF2/index.html)|[pyttsx3 Documentation](https://pyttsx3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/engine.html)|

The main function is setup in such a way that if you just press enter it'll skip the simple page choice, and call the `pdf.read()` method, which will display the PDFs outline, allowing you to select a chapter instead of a page.

```py
from PyPDF4    import PdfFileReader
from threading import Thread

import pyttsx3, os

def main():
    path   = 'Six Easy Pieces.pdf'
    pdf    = PDFExtract(path)
    choice = input("Enter page number: ")

    if choice.isdigit():
        page = int(choice)
        pdf.read_from(page)
    else:
        pdf.read()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

# Sample output from `pdf.read()`

The program will essentially read the PDF aloud, sentence by sentence, while printing what is read to stdout.

# Convenience Functions

Whenever I program something that employs a wait routine on the current thread, I usually spin this function off in the main thread to catch the CTRL+C. The `handle_ctrl_c()` function handles ctrl+c by foregrounding input() and catching EOFError. If we thread the handling of ctrl+c we essentially background the program and listen for input.

```py
def handle_ctrl_c():
    try:
        input()
    except EOFError:
        print("ctrl+c")
        os._exit(1)
```

# The PDFExtract Class

This class will initialize pyttsx3 and set the word rate to 400 words per minute upon instantiation.

```py
class PDFExtract:
    def __init__(self, path, rate=200, multiplier=2):
        self.__path = path

        self.engine = pyttsx3.init()
        self.engine.setProperty('rate', rate*multiplier)

    @property
    def path(self):
        return self.__path
```

# The Read Method

This is really the main focus of our entire program. We will first present the PDFs metadata neatly, followed by the PDFs outline. The user will select a chapter, and the program will begin to read from that chapter. The program will continue to read until CTRL+C or EOF.

```py
def read(self):
    # Display Full Path
    print(f"{self.path}\n")

    with open(self.path, 'rb') as f:
        pdf    = PdfFileReader(f, strict=False)
        menu   = self.extract_info(pdf)
        keys   = menu.keys()

        choice = input("\nSelect: ")
        
        # if not choice.isdigit() and not len(choice) > len(keys):
        if not (choice.isdigit() or len(choice) > len(keys)):
            raise TypeError('Integers Only!')

        choice = int(choice)
        
        if not choice in keys:
            raise ValueError(f"Out of Range: {min(keys)}-{max(keys)}")

        # Read From Selection
        start, title, pageObj = menu[choice]
        self.engine.say(f"{title}, page: {start}.") 
        self.engine.runAndWait()
        self.read_page(pageObj)

        input("Continue?")
        
        for page in range(start+1, pdf.numPages):
            pageObj = pdf.getPage(page)
            self.engine.say(f"Page: {page}.") 
            self.engine.runAndWait()
            self.read_page(pageObj)
```

# The Read From Method

This is a simpler version of the above method that skips the meta and outline and just starts reading to EOF from page input.

```py
def read_from(self, pageNumber):
    # Display Full Path
    print(f"{self.path}\n")

    with open(self.path, 'rb') as f:
        pdf = PdfFileReader(f, strict=False)

        for page in range(pageNumber-1, pdf.numPages):
            pageObj = pdf.getPage(page)
            self.engine.say(f"Page: {page+1}.") 
            self.engine.runAndWait()
            self.read_page(pageObj)
```

# The Read Page Method

This method is used in both `read()` and `read_from()` methods.

```py
def read_page(self, pageObj):
    text  = pageObj.extractText()
    lines = [i.replace("\n", ' ').strip() + '.' for i in text.split('.')]
    
    Thread(target=handle_ctrl_c).start()

    for i, line in enumerate(lines, start=1):
        print(f"{i}: {line}", end="\n\n")
        self.engine.say(line) 
            self.engine.runAndWait()
```

# The Extract Info Method

This method is the workhorse of the text extraction. This is where the outline is parsed as well.

```py
def extract_info(self, pdf):
    '''
    This method will prompt the PDF's outline and return a menu dictionary.

    The menu dictionary's data structure is as follows:

    {
        index: (pageNumber <int>, obj.title <TextStringObject>, pdf.getPage <PageObject>), 
        index: ...,
        ...
    }
    '''
    docInfo  = pdf.documentInfo
    numPages = pdf.numPages
    outlines = pdf.outlines
    menu     = dict()

    # Extract PDF Metadata
    for property in ['author', 'creator', 'producer', 'subject', 'title']:
        print(f"{property.capitalize():<11}: {getattr(docInfo, property)}")

    # Display Page Count
    print(f"Page Count : {numPages}")

    # Display Outline Neatly
    print(f"\nGenerating Outline\n")
    for i, obj in enumerate(outlines, start=1):
        print(f"{i:>4} {obj.title}")
        pageNumber = pdf.getDestinationPageNumber(obj)
        menu[i]    = (pageNumber, obj.title, pdf.getPage(pageNumber))

    return menu
```

## **Lifestyle, Diet & Exercise**

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vMZfyEy_jpI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Generally, foods that increase serotonin and brain health should be incorporated into your diet. Below I've made a list of my own findings that seem to match what Dr. Berg is saying. 

- Salmon, eggs, some cheese, blueberries, almonds, spinach, turkey, avocado, fresh garlic, avocado oil for cooking, olive oil for dressing, olives, high fiber.
- Organic, grass-fed, and non-gmo being of vital importance.
- Exercise and light therapy "sunlight" (Vitamin D) are also beneficial. 
- Avoid all forms of smoking.
- Avoid all forms of heavy drinking.
- Reduce your sugar intake with stevia. 
- Vitamin K2 & Bs.

In my youth I was able to reach *31 chin-ups consecutively* (from a dead hang while fully extended each time). For comparison, I had surpassed the highest repetition count for pull-ups In the Marine Corps PFT (23) on my own. Even though this was accomplished many years ago, and I have not since kept up with this form of exercise, it was one of my earlier accomplishments in life worth noting.

> "But in addition to this, my son, be warned: the making of many books is endless, and much devotion to books is wearying to the flesh." &mdash; Ecclesiastes 12:12 LSB

Unfortunately, I've let myself go for over a decade and because I am ectomorphic I've returned to a state that doesn't resemble the hard work of my youth. Having said that, I intend to slowly build back over time.

## **The Philosophy Of Stoicism**

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R9OCA6UFE-0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Stoicism is an excellent way to handle the vicissitudes of life. As you progress in life and become successful at whatever it is you're doing, whether it is physical, intellectual, financial, or spiritual pursuits; you will begin to attract creditors, predators, critics, and generally not very good people.

<!-- > "Say to yourself first thing in the morning: today I shall meet people who are meddling, ungrateful, aggressive, treacherous, malicious, unsocial. All this has afflicted them through their ignorance of true good and evil." &mdash; Emperor Marcus Aurelius' Meditations, Chapter 2. Written among the Quadi on the River Gran -->

> ‚ÄúWhen you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. They are like this because they can't tell good from evil." &mdash; Emperor Marcus Aurelius' Meditations, Chapter 2. Written among the Quadi on the River Gran

One way to deal with people like this, is not with immaturity, but with stoicism and equanimity. I am reminded of the wise words of Lucius Annaeus Seneca the Younger in De Tranquillitate Animi ([On the Tranquility of the Mind](https://youtu.be/vl5WDfwY4PY?t=1032)) in his ninth book of the dialogues:

> "hence comes the State of Mind of those who loathe their idleness complain that they have nothing to do and view the progress of others with the bitterest jealousy for an unhappy sloth favours the growth of envy and those who cannot succeed themselves wish everyone else to be ruined."

Epictetus is another stoic philosopher that will help you deal with vicious attacks from others.

> ‚ÄúI laugh at those who think they can damage me. They do not know who I am, they do not know what I think, they cannot even touch the things which are really mine and with which I live.‚Äù &mdash; Epictetus

> ‚ÄúThe key is to keep company only with people who uplift you, whose presence calls forth your best.‚Äù &mdash; Epictetus

## **Focus & Inner Peace**

It can be difficult to remain focused and free from distraction. For me this almost always takes the form of noise. One way to remain in tune with what you're doing is with some form of ambient sound to peacefully drown out distractions.

> Delta Waves ‚Äì Sleep Music / NREM sleep, Alpha Waves are neural oscillations, Theta Waves (Cortical theta rhythm and Hippocampal theta rhythm). Beta waves associated with muscle contractions in isotonic movements, Gamma waves can help to release serotonin, endorphin and dopamine, so it works as happiness music for depression treatment. &mdash; Greenred Productions

<!-- Alpha Waves help your mind to get to the state of focus, which is perfect for studying or preparing for exam or test you have at school or university. It also maintains your alertness while studying. Superintelligence beta waves will help to concentrate for tasks, enhance intelligence. -->

## **Conclusion**

For myself, I intend to focus my efforts on the following pursuits in no particular order.

- ***Piano*** for its effects upon the corpus callosum. I also enjoy this activity.
- ***Python*** because I need to maintain this skill as it will be extremely useful in the future in combination with physics, not to mention it also stimulates neuroplasticity and in conjunction with this blog, acts as an expression of the feynman technique.
- ***Physics*** for its effects upon neuroplasticity. This is where most of the study techniques mentioned above will be applied, as it is a new addition to the lineup, one which I will likely undergo formally.
- ***Esperanto*** because of its ability to amplify problem solving ability, perception, and for its propaedeutic properties in preparing the mind for multilingualism while maintaining adherence to telescope rule.

My advice to you, if you're trying to implement some of these ideas into your own life, is to utilize telescope rule. Start small and work your way up. Choose an instrument, choose a language, and decide on which way you'd like to increase neuroplasticity through chess or science. Eat healthy, exercise regularly, and remain equanimous in trying times.
