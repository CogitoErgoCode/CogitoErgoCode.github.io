Hello, my name is Ryan and I am a programmer, [esperantist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto), aspiring classical pianist, and life long <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodidacticism" style="color:#0073e6;">autodidact</a>.

## üìú Wisdom & Philosophy

<!-- Recent revelatory epiphanies I‚Äôve been attempting to enact. These number among the most difficult things a man can subdue unto himself. It‚Äôs easy to live a life of epicureanism, but a true test of inner strength is to imbue one‚Äôs soul with stoic equanimity. While my beliefs rest in Christ, my philosophy is not blind to... keep in mind that belief and philosophy are separate. -->

The word philosophy comes from the Greek word philosophia (œÜŒπŒªŒøœÉŒøœÜŒØŒ±), which means 'love of wisdom'. There is some overlap in my metaphysical & epistemological views.

<!-- > Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence [[Aretƒì]](https://biblehub.com/greek/703.htm), if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. &mdash; Philippians 4:8 -->

<!-- > Even Gentiles, who do not have God‚Äôs written law, show that they know his law when they instinctively obey it, even without having heard it. They demonstrate that God‚Äôs law is written in their hearts, for their own conscience and thoughts either accuse them or tell them they are doing right. &mdash; Romans 2:14-15 -->

<!-- > ‚ÄúHow much time he gains who does not look to see what his neighbour says or does or thinks, but only at what he does himself, to make it just and holy.‚Äù &mdash; Emperor Marcus Aurelius, Meditations  -->

# Metaphysics (The Ultimate Structure of Reality)

My metaphysical views fall within the ontological [mind-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_problem), more specifically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism" style="color:#006699;">mind‚Äìbody dualism</a>. I believe this harmonizes with a cosmology of higher spatial dimensions. There are only two forms of monism that I find interesting, the first is Leibniz's Monadology, and the other is Tegmark's Ultimate Ensemble. What I find interesting and what I believe, are two different things.

In any mathematical structure complex enough to contain such substructures, they "will subjectively perceive themselves as existing in a physically 'real' world"|

# Epistemology (The Nature of Knowledge)

My epistemological views fall within the school of rationalism (the criterion of the truth is not sensory but intellectual and deductive) like that of Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz (created calculus like Newton, Leibniz paved the way for Einstein's theory of relativity), G√∂del, and Einstein (called himself a "Leibnizian," and was also a Spinozist). etc. I'm also a fan of skeptical scenarios.

<!-- First Principals: from which much can be deduced. For example, Einstein's Theory of Relativity can be used to calculate the effect of the speed of a satellite on time in order to sync a highly accurate clock with Earth time. This can all be done with theories and equations that Einstein produced with rational thought. -->

<!-- Leibniz's best known contribution to metaphysics is his theory of monads, as exposited in Monadologie. He proposes his theory that the universe is made of an infinite number of simple substances known as monads.[72] Monads can also be compared to the corpuscles of the mechanical philosophy of Ren√© Descartes and others. These simple substances or monads are the "ultimate units of existence in nature". Monads have no parts but still exist by the qualities that they have. These qualities are continuously changing over time, and each monad is unique. They are also not affected by time and are subject to only creation and annihilation.[73] Monads are centers of force; substance is force, while space, matter, and motion are merely phenomenal. It is said that he anticipated Albert Einstein by arguing, against Newton, that space, time, and motion are completely relative as he quipped,[74] "As for my own opinion, I have said more than once, that I hold space to be something merely relative, as time is, that I hold it to be an order of coexistences, as time is an order of successions."[75] Einstein, who called himself a "Leibnizian" even wrote in the introduction to Max Jammer's book Concepts of Space that Leibnizianism was superior to Newtonianism, and his ideas would have dominated over Newton's had it not been for the poor technological tools of the time; it has been argued that Leibniz paved the way for Einstein's theory of relativity.[76]

Leibniz distinguishes three forms of evil: moral, physical, and metaphysical. Moral evil is sin, physical evil is pain, and metaphysical evil is limitation.[4] God permits moral and physical evil for the sake of greater goods, and metaphysical evil (i.e., limitation) is unavoidable since any created universe must necessarily fall short of God's absolute perfection.

Leibniz's proof of God can be summarized in the Th√©odic√©e.[77] Reason is governed by the principle of contradiction and the principle of sufficient reason. Using the principle of reasoning, Leibniz concluded that the first reason of all things is God.[77] All that we see and experience is subject to change, and the fact that this world is contingent can be explained by the possibility of the world being arranged differently in space and time. The contingent world must have some necessary reason for its existence. Leibniz uses a geometry book as an example to explain his reasoning. If this book was copied from an infinite chain of copies, there must be some reason for the content of the book.[78] Leibniz concluded that there must be the "monas monadum" or God.

The ontological essence of a monad is its irreducible simplicity. Unlike atoms, monads possess no material or spatial character. They also differ from atoms by their complete mutual independence, so that interactions among monads are only apparent. Instead, by virtue of the principle of pre-established harmony, each monad follows a pre-programmed set of "instructions" peculiar to itself, so that a monad "knows" what to do at each moment. By virtue of these intrinsic instructions, each monad is like a little mirror of the universe. Monads need not be "small"; e.g., each human being constitutes a monad, in which case free will is problematic.

Monads are purported to have gotten rid of the problematic:

interaction between mind and matter arising in the system of Descartes;
lack of individuation inherent to the system of Spinoza, which represents individual creatures as merely accidental. -->

# Ethics (Moral Philosophy)

My ethics views fall within virtue ethics. I've found [equanimity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equanimity) to be a reoccurring theme in the philosophies I gravitate towards. According to the Greek Stoics, [apatheia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apatheia) was the quality that characterized the sage. The Roman Stoics called it [aequanimitas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equanimity).

<!-- *Kurt G√∂del's Platonism[8] postulates a special kind of mathematical intuition that lets us perceive mathematical objects directly. (This view bears resemblances to many things Husserl said about mathematics, and supports Kant's idea that mathematics is synthetic a priori.) Davis and Hersh have suggested in their 1999 book The Mathematical Experience that most mathematicians act as though they are Platonists, even though, if pressed to defend the position carefully, they may retreat to formalism. The mathematician Alexander Grothendieck was also a Platonist.* -->

<!-- ## üé∏ Music & Styles From My Past

In my past I was a much different person than I am now, but I thought I'd show you all where I come from. Some of these songs invoke a sense of nostalgia, and I am somewhat sentimental over the memories that they conjure. There is some new music in here, but only to reflect what I would be listening to, if I had not changed course.

> ‚ÄúIt is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.‚Äù &mdash; Aristotle, Metaphysics

> ‚ÄúIt is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.‚Äù &mdash; Theodore Roosevelt, "Citizenship in a Republic", a speech at the Sorbonne, Paris, France (23 April 1910)

yourself in a world
which is doing its best day and night to make you like
everybody else means to fight the hardest battle
which any human being can fight and never stop fighting." &mdash; E.E. Cummings -->

<!-- > "Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. <a href="https://youtu.be/cJMwBwFj5nQ" style="color:#0073e6;">Be water, my friend</a>." &mdash; Bruce Lee -->
