# **My Pencil & Paper Solution**

- `Hints: 8,9,14`
We can see that the Norwegian lives in the first house and that he lives next to the blue house. We also learn here that the owner who lives in the center house drinks milk.

| ???           | **Blue** | ???      | ??? | ??? |
| **Norwegian** | ???      | ???      | ??? | ??? |
| ???           | ???      | **Milk** | ??? | ??? |
| ???           | ???      | ???      | ??? | ??? |
| ???           | ???      | ???      | ??? | ??? |

- `Hints: 4,5`
Since the owner of the green house drinks coffee he cannot be the owner in the center.
That leaves the `first`, `fourth`, and `fifth` positions open, however in hint #5 we see that he
lives on the left of the house that is white so "Mr. Green" cannot be `first` either.
That leaves position `four`, and `five`. The last deduction is that he must live in the `forth` house
because the `fifth` position isn't left of anything. 

| ???           | Blue  | ???      | **Green**  | **White** |
| Norwegian     | ???   | ???      | ???        | ???       |
| ???           | ???   | Milk     | **Coffee** | ???       |
| ???           | ???   | ???      | ???        | ???       |
| ???           | ???   | ???      | ???        | ???       |

- `Hint: 1`
If the Norwegian lives in the first house and the Brit lives in the red house then that places
the `red house square in the center`. This means the `Norwegian lives in the yellow house`.

| **Yellow**    | Blue  | **Red**  | Green  | White |
| Norwegian     | ???   | **Brit** | ???    | ???   |
| ???           | ???   | Milk     | Coffee | ???   |
| ???           | ???   | ???      | ???    | ???   |
| ???           | ???   | ???      | ???    | ???   |

- `hint: 15`
The man who smokes blends lives next to someone who drinks water, this hint eliminates 
the white house, leaving either `yellow` or `blue`.

- `Hint: 7`
The `Norwegian smokes Dunhill` so this bring us back to hint 15, if the Norwegian smokes Dunhill and not blends, only the owner of the `blue house smokes blends`. Let's not forget that the man who
smokes blends also lives next to someone who drinks water, and since the Brit drinks milk, we can deduce that the `Norwegian drinks water`.

| Yellow      | Blue       | Red  | Green  | White |
| Norwegian   | ???        | Brit | ???    | ???   |
| **Water**   | ???        | Milk | Coffee | ???   |
| **Dunhill** | **Blends** | ???  | ???    | ???   |
| ???         | ???        | ???  | ???    | ???   |

- `Hint: 11`
We see here that the owner who keeps the horses lives next to the man who smokes Dunhill.

| Yellow    | Blue       | Red  | Green  | White |
| Norwegian | ???        | Brit | ???    | ???   |
| Water     | ???        | Milk | Coffee | ???   |
| Dunhill   | Blends     | ???  | ???    | ???   |
| ???       | **Horses** | ???  | ???    | ???   |

- `Hint: 12`
If the owner who smokes BlueMaster drinks beer, only `Blue & White` are possible houses.
Since the owner of the blue house already smokes blends, we have deduced that the owner of
the `white house smokes BlueMaster and drinks beer`

- It looks as though through process of elimination we've also deduced that the owner of the `blue
house drinks tea`.

- `Hint: 3`
The Dane happens to drink tea

| Yellow    | Blue     | Red  | Green  | White            |
| Norwegian | **Dane** | Brit | ???    | ???              |
| Water     | **Tea**  | Milk | Coffee | **Beer**         |
| Dunhill   | Blends   | ???  | ???    | **BlueMaster** |
| ???       | Horses   | ???  | ???    | ???              |

- `Hint: 2, 13`
The German smokes Prince, he must live in the green house since white smokes BlueMaster and the
other houses are already occupied (i.e. Red -> Brit), ergo the `German lives in the green house`.

- Process of elimination has also revealed that the remaining race left is the Swede, therefore the
`Swede must live in the white house`.

- `Hint: 2`
The Swede keeps dogs as pets

| Yellow    | Blue   | Red  | Green      | White      |
| Norwegian | Dane   | Brit | **German** | **Swede**  |
| Water     | Tea    | Milk | Coffee     | Beer       |
| Dunhill   | Blends | ???  | **Prince** | BlueMaster |
| ???       | Horses | ???  | ???        | **Dogs**   |

- Yet another process of elimination on who smokes what, reveals one spot left for Pall Mall.
`The Brit must smoke Pall Mall`.

- `Hint: 6`
We also find in hint #6 that the person who smokes Pall Mall also rears birds. `The Brit rears birds`.

| Yellow    | Blue   | Red           | Green  | White      |
| Norwegian | Dane   | Brit          | German | Swede      |
| Water     | Tea    | Milk          | Coffee | Beer       |
| Dunhill   | Blends | **Pall Mall** | Prince | BlueMaster |
| ???       | Horses | **Birds**     | ???    | Dogs       |

- `Hint: 10`
For our final clue, we learn that the individual who smokes blends lives next to the one who keeps cats. `We find that not only is it the Norwegian who keeps cats`, but through process of elimination we have solved the final piece of the puzzle, and that is that `the German owns the fish`!

| Yellow    | Blue   | Red       | Green    | White      |
| Norwegian | Dane   | Brit      | German   | Swede      |
| Water     | Tea    | Milk      | Coffee   | Beer       |
| Dunhill   | Blends | Pall Mall | Prince   | BlueMaster |
| **Cats**  | Horses | Birds     | **Fish** | Dogs       |

So there you have it, the German owns the fish. This was an article I wrote on WordPress
back in 2016, but I had worked out the solution some years earlier on paper.
