Before journeying into a debate, however logically sound our position may be, we should always attempt to maintain rational discourse by preparing ourselves to delineate, through memorization, a set of logical errors called [informal fallacies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#Informal_fallacies), upon encountering them. I have found that these errors in logic are constantly and continuously employed by a large percentage of people in debate. I will describe a few of the most relevant fallacies.

# Red Herring Fallacies

> "A red herring fallacy, **one of the main subtypes of fallacies of relevance**, is an error in logic where a proposition is, or is intended to be, misleading in order to make irrelevant or false inferences. This includes any logical inference based on fake arguments, intended to replace the lack of real arguments or to replace implicitly the subject of the discussion." &mdash; [Red Herring Fallacies (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#Red_herring_fallacies)

- **`Argumentum ad hominem:`** An `Ad hominem` attack is an error in logic, which leads the loser of said argument, to attack the arguer instead of the argument. A very true statement (verified by the logic above) often attributed to (Irrelevant) the Greek philosopher Socrates, states "When the debate is lost, slander becomes the tool of the losers." Subtypes of ad hominem include: circumstantial, poisoning the well, appeal to motive, tone policing & traitorous critic fallacy.

    Simply, if anyone starts name calling or attacking the debater instead of maturely debating the topic, it is looked at as an immediate loss.

    - Another closely related red herring fallacy called `Tu quoque` which is an `appeal to hypocrisy` also known as an `whataboutism`, states that a position is false, wrong, or should be disregarded because its proponent fails to act consistently in accordance with it.

        Simply, if someone avoids the debate at hand by showcasing supposed hypocrisy in your life, this is also an error in their logic and an immediate fail on their part.

- **`Argumentum ad passiones:`** Also known as an `appeal to emotion`, an error in logic which attempts to manipulate the emotions of the listener rather than using valid reasoning to obtain a common agreement. Subtypes of ad passiones include: fear, flattery, pity (argumentum ad misericordiam), ridicule (reductio ad ridiculum, reductio ad absurdum, ad absurdum), spite, judgmental language, Pooh-pooh & Wishful thinking.
    
    - `Reductio ad absurdum` or an `Appeal to ridicule` would be a very good example ‚Äì mocking or stating that the opponent's position is laughable to deflect from the merits of the opponent's argument. I think we've all, at some point in our lives, experienced this type of juvenile response. This is unsurprisingly a failure in logic.

        > "Do not correct a scoffer, lest he hate you;
        Rebuke a wise man, and he will love you.
        Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be still wiser;
        Teach a just man, and he will increase in learning." &mdash; Proverbs 9:8-9

        Not to be confused with: `Argumentum ad lapidem` or an `appeal to the stone` which is defined as, dismissing a claim as absurd without demonstrating proof for its absurdity. Ad lapidem is only a relevance fallacy and not of the red herring subtype. Notice the difference between ad absurdum and ad lapidem, one is ridiculing and irrelevant while the other is simply irrelevant.

    - Another good example of ad absurdum would be `ad misericordiam` or an appeal to pity, a fallacy in which someone tries to win support for an argument or idea by exploiting his opponent's feelings of pity or guilt. This is an error in logic and an immediate loss. 
    <!-- Personally, I also find pathos based rhetoric juvenile. -->

        > "Do not hasten in your spirit to be angry, For anger rests in the bosom of fools." &mdash; Ecclesiastes 7:9

- **`Argumentum ad verecundiam:`** An `appeal to authority` is where an assertion is deemed true because of the position or authority of the person asserting it. Subtypes of `ad verecundiam` include: Appeal to accomplishment & Courtier's reply.

    - I think the best example of this is the `Courtier's reply` (a criticism is dismissed by claiming that the critic lacks sufficient knowledge, credentials, or training to credibly comment on the subject matter.
 
        Simply, if someone attacks your "lack of credentials" or credibility instead of focusing on the argument, they have lost the debate. You could also apply ad verecundiam to people who assert that they are right because they are older and "know better". *To whom it may concern, I did not use this on you, I was referring to my older age as having given me memories of a time since past, but I think it was misconstrued. Apologies for lack of clarification.*

- **`Argumentum ad crumenam:`** An `appeal to wealth` also known as an `argument to the purse`, is the informal fallacy of concluding that a statement is incorrect because the speaker is poor, or that a statement is correct because the speaker is rich. 

    - An example might be: "If you're so smart, why aren't you rich?"
    
        This type of conclusion is an error in logic. Essentially, nothing is "above your pay-grade". No matter your tax bracket, the merits of your argument should be taken seriously. 

- **`Argumentum ad populum:`** An `appeal to the majority`, is a proposition that is claimed to be true or good solely because a majority or many people believe it to be so. This is also known as: the bandwagon argument.

    - I think Einstein said it best when he said:
        > ‚ÄúWhat is right is not always popular and what is popular is not always right.‚Äù &mdash; Albert Einstein 

- **`Straw man fallacy:`** Last but not least, misrepresenting an opponent's argument by broadening or narrowing the scope of a premise and/or refuting a weaker version of their argument.

<!-- - This form of misrepresentation is used a lot by the cults, especially in the witness organization. One example would be when they claim that Christians believe in a "three headed God," referring to the Trinity, when this has never been a held belief of any follower of Christ. From the early church fathers on down to present day, Christians have said and taught the same thing that Christ and the Apostles taught, that there is only one God in three personages.

    Nevertheless, they continue to misrepresent what Christ, the Apostles, and all Christians have taught and believed from the very beginning, in order to strengthen their false argument.
    
    It's ironic that they continue with this line of erroneous thinking, when it was their very organization that has divided the one God into multiple individual gods (see John 1:1-3,14 they added the letter 'a' which doesn't appear in the greek essentially splitting Jesus & God into two) -->

# Relevance Fallacies 

A subtype of Informal fallacy (arguments that are logically unsound for lack of well-grounded premises).

- **`Argumentum ad lapidem`** or an `appeal to the stone,` which is defined as, dismissing a claim as absurd without demonstrating proof for its absurdity. Not to be confused with `reductio ad absurdum` or an `appeal to ridicule` (see Red Herring Fallacies)

- **`Argumentum ad ignorantiam`** or an `appeal to ignorance:` Assuming that a claim is false because it has not been or cannot be proven true, or vice versa, assuming that a claim is true because it has not been or cannot be proven false.

    - For example: Assuming there is no God, because it has not been or cannot be proven, is just as illogical as assuming there is a God, because it has not been or cannot be disproven. 
    
        What lacks proof today may have proof tomorrow, which would mean, it was just as true the day it had no proof as the day in which the proof was found. We do not base our conclusions upon this form of faulty reasoning. 
    
    <!-- Further, to ask for scientifically testable, material, non-transcendent evidence for an immaterial, transcendent God or hyper-dimensional entity (i.e. demon) is embarrassingly illogical. Shutting down argumentation for God stymies scientific progress in the discovery of life in the cosmos beyond our own, which may indeed be of a higher spatial dimensionality, existing outside of our 3-dimensional understanding. -->

    <!-- The life scientists are searching for in the cosmos may indeed be of a higher spatial dimensionality, existing outside of our 3-dimensional understanding. They're perhaps looking in the wrong place. -->
    
<!-- 
- The problem with the Atheists claim that God does't exist, because there is no proof is that Christians don't believe in a material God either. We believe in a Transcendent God, so asking for material proof by scientific method demonstrates both and error in logic (Argumentum ad ignorantiam), and a lack of understanding in what Christians believe.
- The scientific method, created by a brilliant scientist and philosopher of science by the name of Sir Francis Bacon, is a system of learning that consists of observation, hypothesis, experimentation, prediction, and theory. It is based on logic and observations of the material universe and its properties. Bacon was a devout Christian.
-->

<!-- > The wicked fool says in his heart, ‚ÄúThere is no God.‚Äù
They act corruptly, they commit abominable deeds;
There is no one who does good. &mdash; Psalm 14:1 -->

- **`Argumentum ad nauseam`** or `argumentum ad infinitum` otherwise known as an `Argument from repetition:` Repeating an argument until nobody cares to discuss it any more and referencing that lack of objection as evidence of support for the truth of the conclusion.

# The Laws of Thought

The argument often arises, that all religions are right; however, this is not logically possible because it violates the the laws of thought, specifically the law of non-contradiction. To deny these laws, one would be using these laws in the process, thus self-refuting them. If one says "There's no such thing as truth." That's a truth claim, to which you should respond "Except the truth that there is no truth?" ergo Self-Refutation. So today we will be logically deducing the truth... Since there is one.

> "The **laws of thought** are fundamental axiomatic rules upon which rational discourse itself is often considered to be based. The formulation and clarification of such rules have a long tradition in the history of philosophy and logic." &mdash; [Law of thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_thought#Three_traditional_laws:_identity,_non-contradiction,_excluded_middle)

The laws in question are as follows:

- **`The law of identity:`** *"Whatever is, is."* For all a: a = a.
    - The law of identity states that if a statement has been determined to be true, then the statement is true. For example, if I make a statement that 'It is snowing,' and it is the truth, then the statement must be true. If we look at the law of identity in more general terms, it says that each thing that exists is made up of its own particular characteristics that are a part of what it is.

        > If a propositional function F is true of an individual variable x, then F is true of x, or: F(x) ‚äÉ F(x), in which ‚äÉ means ‚Äúformally implies.‚Äù Another formulation of the principle of identity asserts that a thing is identical with itself, or (‚àÄx) (x = x), in which ‚àÄ means ‚Äúfor every‚Äù; or simply that x is x. &mdash; [Websters](https://www.britannica.com/topic/laws-of-thought)

        When you apply this to logic, the law of identity essentially means that everything is itself and it cannot be something else. Snow cannot be clouds, and water cannot be a pole. Each thing is something specific that has a particular identity. So when I say that it is snowing, snowing refers to a particular event. Given that 'snowing' refers to a specific thing, if I make this statement while it is actually snowing, then it must be a true statement.

- **`The law of non-contradiction:`** *"Nothing can both be and not be."* In other words: "two or more contradictory statements cannot both be true in the same sense at the same time": ¬¨(A‚àß¬¨A). Essentially, Two truths cannot contradict one another. Aristotle stated it in this way, that "The most certain opinion of all" was "that opposed statements cannot be at the same time true."
    - On the other hand, for any pair of contradictory premises, one must be true and the other false. The Law of Non-Contradiction prevents both premises being true, while the Law of Excluded Middle points out that a pair of contradictory premises exhausts all possibilities. 

        > For all propositions p, it is impossible for both p and not p to be true, or: ‚àº(p ¬∑ ‚àºp), in which ‚àº means ‚Äúnot‚Äù and ¬∑ means ‚Äúand.‚Äù &mdash; [Websters](https://www.britannica.com/topic/laws-of-thought)
        
        Another way of putting it is: a proposition must be either true or false‚Äînot both true and false, nor in some limbo state in between truth and falsity. This can be useful in listing all possible alternatives and refuting all of them but the correct one.

- **`The law of excluded middle:`** *"Everything must either be or not be."* for every proposition, either its positive or negative form is true: A‚à®¬¨A.

    - A principle in modern logic that means something is either true or it is false. There is no "middle" between true and false. In classical logic, this principle for a proposition A would be A‚à®¬¨A. Its opposite is dialetheism. 

        > Either p or ‚àºp must be true, there being no third or middle true proposition between them, or: p ‚à® ‚àºp, in which ‚à® means ‚Äúor.‚Äù &mdash; [Websters](https://www.britannica.com/topic/laws-of-thought)
