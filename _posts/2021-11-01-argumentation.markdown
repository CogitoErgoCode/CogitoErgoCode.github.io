<!-- ## **A Guide To Maintaining Rational Discourse** -->

Before journeying into a debate, however logically sound our position may be, we should attempt to maintain rational discourse by preparing ourselves to delineate both the axiomatic laws of thought and a set of logical errors known as [informal fallacies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#Informal_fallacies). I have found that these errors in logic are constantly and continuously employed by a large percentage of people in debate. I will describe a few of the most relevant fallacies. However, I first wish to address the laws of thought.

> "There is no greater evil one can suffer than to hate reasonable discourse." &mdash; Socrates, Phaedo, Plato's account of Socrates' death.

## **The Laws of Thought**

The three fundamental laws of logic are fundamental axiomatic rules upon which rational discourse itself is based. The three laws can be stated symbolically as follows:

1. **`The law of contradiction (or non-contradiction)`**

    Essentially, Two truths cannot contradict one another. Aristotle stated it in this way, that "The most certain opinion of all" was "that opposed statements cannot be at the same time true." On the other hand, for any pair of contradictory premises, one must be true and the other false. The Law of Non-Contradiction prevents both premises being true, while the Law of Excluded Middle points out that a pair of contradictory premises exhausts all possibilities.

    > For all propositions p, it is impossible for both p and not p to be true, or: ∼(p · ∼p), in which ∼ means “not” and · means “and.” &mdash; [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/laws-of-thought)

    The argument often arises, that all religions are right; however, this is not logically possible because it violates the the laws of thought, specifically the law of non-contradiction. To deny these laws, one would be using these laws in the process, thus self-refuting them. If one says "There's no such thing as truth." That's a truth claim, to which you should respond "Except the truth that there is no truth?" ergo Self-Refutation. 

    > *'Nothing can both be and not be.'* In other words: *"two or more contradictory statements cannot both be true in the same sense at the same time"*: ¬(A∧¬A). &mdash; [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_thought#Three_traditional_laws:_identity,_non-contradiction,_excluded_middle)

    Another way of putting it is: a proposition must be either true or false—not both true and false, nor in some limbo state in between truth and falsity. This can be useful in listing all possible alternatives and refuting all of them but the correct one.
2. **`The law of excluded middle (or third)`**

    A principle in modern logic that means something is either true or it is false. There is no "middle" between true and false. In classical logic, this principle for a proposition A would be A∨¬A. Its opposite is dialetheism.

    > Either p or ∼p must be true, there being no third or middle true proposition between them, or: p ∨ ∼p, in which ∨ means “or.” &mdash; [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/laws-of-thought)

    > *'Everything must either be or not be.'* In accordance with the law of excluded middle or excluded third, for every proposition, either its positive or negative form is true: A∨¬A. &mdash; [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_thought#Three_traditional_laws:_identity,_non-contradiction,_excluded_middle)
3. **`The principle (or law) of identity`**

    The law of identity states that if a statement has been determined to be true, then the statement is true. Here is an example, if I make a statement that 'It is storming,' and it is the truth, then the statement must be true. Imagine that! Applying this logically, lightning cannot be rain, a frog cannot be a dragon, each thing is something specific unto itself and has it's own particular identity.

    > If a propositional function F is true of an individual variable x, then F is true of x, or: F(x) ⊃ F(x), in which ⊃ means “formally implies.” &mdash; [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/laws-of-thought)
    >> Another formulation of the principle of identity asserts that a thing is identical with itself, or (∀x) (x = x), in which ∀ means “for every”; or simply that x is x.

    > *'Whatever is, is.'* For all a: a = a. &mdash; [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_thought#Three_traditional_laws:_identity,_non-contradiction,_excluded_middle)

## **Informal Fallacies**

Arguments that are logically unsound for lack of well-grounded premises.

>  In philosophy, reasoning that fails to establish its conclusion because of deficiencies in form or wording. Informal fallacies are types of inductive argument the premises of which fail to establish the conclusion because of their content. &mdash; [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/summary/fallacy)

> Informal fallacies are a type of incorrect argument in natural language. The source of the error is not just due to the form of the argument, as is the case for formal fallacies, but can also be due to their content and context. Fallacies, despite being incorrect, usually appear to be correct and thereby can seduce people into accepting and using them. &mdash; [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_fallacy)

# Fallacies of Relevance (Relevance Fallacies)

A subtype of Informal fallacy (arguments that are logically unsound for lack of well-grounded premises).

- **`Argumentum ad lapidem`** or an `appeal to the stone,` which is defined as, dismissing a claim as absurd without demonstrating proof for its absurdity. Not to be confused with `reductio ad absurdum` or an `appeal to ridicule` (see Red Herring Fallacies)

- **`Argumentum ad ignorantiam`** or an `appeal to ignorance:` Assuming that a claim is false because it has not been or cannot be proven true, or vice versa, assuming that a claim is true because it has not been or cannot be proven false.

    - For example: Assuming there is no God, because it has not been or cannot be proven, is just as illogical as assuming there is a God, because it has not been or cannot be disproven. 
    
        What lacks proof today may have proof tomorrow, which would mean, it was just as true the day it had no proof as the day in which the proof was found. We do not base our conclusions upon this form of faulty reasoning. 
    
    <!-- Further, to ask for scientifically testable, material, non-transcendent evidence for an immaterial, transcendent God or hyper-dimensional entity (i.e. demon) is embarrassingly illogical. Shutting down argumentation for God stymies scientific progress in the discovery of life in the cosmos beyond our own, which may indeed be of a higher spatial dimensionality, existing outside of our 3-dimensional understanding. -->

    <!-- The life scientists are searching for in the cosmos may indeed be of a higher spatial dimensionality, existing outside of our 3-dimensional understanding. They're perhaps looking in the wrong place. -->
    
<!-- 
- The problem with the Atheists claim that God does't exist, because there is no proof is that Christians don't believe in a material God either. We believe in a Transcendent God, so asking for material proof by scientific method demonstrates both and error in logic (Argumentum ad ignorantiam), and a lack of understanding in what Christians believe.
- The scientific method, created by a brilliant scientist and philosopher of science by the name of Sir Francis Bacon, is a system of learning that consists of observation, hypothesis, experimentation, prediction, and theory. It is based on logic and observations of the material universe and its properties. Bacon was a devout Christian.
-->

<!-- > The wicked fool says in his heart, “There is no God.”
They act corruptly, they commit abominable deeds;
There is no one who does good. &mdash; Psalm 14:1 -->

- **`Argumentum ad nauseam`** or `argumentum ad infinitum` otherwise known as an `Argument from repetition:` Repeating an argument until nobody cares to discuss it any more and referencing that lack of objection as evidence of support for the truth of the conclusion.

# Red Herring Fallacies

> "A red herring fallacy, **one of the main subtypes of fallacies of relevance**, is an error in logic where a proposition is, or is intended to be, misleading in order to make irrelevant or false inferences. This includes any logical inference based on fake arguments, intended to replace the lack of real arguments or to replace implicitly the subject of the discussion." &mdash; [Red Herring Fallacies (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#Red_herring_fallacies)

- **`Argumentum ad hominem:`** An `Ad hominem` attack is an error in logic, which leads the loser of said argument, to attack the arguer instead of the argument. A very true statement (verified by the logic above) often attributed to (Irrelevant) the Greek philosopher Socrates, states "When the debate is lost, slander becomes the tool of the losers." Subtypes of ad hominem include: circumstantial, poisoning the well, appeal to motive, tone policing & traitorous critic fallacy.

    Simply, if anyone starts name calling or attacking the debater instead of maturely debating the topic, it is looked at as an immediate loss.

    - Another closely related red herring fallacy called `Tu quoque` which is an `appeal to hypocrisy` also known as an `whataboutism`, states that a position is false, wrong, or should be disregarded because its proponent fails to act consistently in accordance with it.

        Simply, if someone avoids the debate at hand by showcasing supposed hypocrisy in your life, this is also an error in their logic and an immediate fail on their part.

- **`Argumentum ad passiones:`** Also known as an `appeal to emotion`, an error in logic which attempts to manipulate the emotions of the listener rather than using valid reasoning to obtain a common agreement. Subtypes of ad passiones include: fear, flattery, pity (argumentum ad misericordiam), ridicule (reductio ad ridiculum, reductio ad absurdum, ad absurdum), spite, judgmental language, Pooh-pooh & Wishful thinking.
    
    - `Reductio ad absurdum` or an `Appeal to ridicule` would be a very good example – mocking or stating that the opponent's position is laughable to deflect from the merits of the opponent's argument. I think we've all, at some point in our lives, experienced this type of juvenile response. This is unsurprisingly a failure in logic.

        > "Do not correct a scoffer, lest he hate you;
        Rebuke a wise man, and he will love you.
        Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be still wiser;
        Teach a just man, and he will increase in learning." &mdash; Proverbs 9:8-9

        Not to be confused with: `Argumentum ad lapidem` or an `appeal to the stone` which is defined as, dismissing a claim as absurd without demonstrating proof for its absurdity. Ad lapidem is only a relevance fallacy and not of the red herring subtype. Notice the difference between ad absurdum and ad lapidem, one is ridiculing and irrelevant while the other is simply irrelevant.

    - Another good example of ad passiones would be `ad misericordiam` or an appeal to pity, a fallacy in which someone tries to win support for an argument or idea by exploiting his opponent's feelings of pity or guilt. This is an error in logic and an immediate loss. 
        
        > "All men suffer, but not all men pity themselves" &mdash; Emperor Marcus Aurelius

<!-- > "Do not hasten in your spirit to be angry, For anger rests in the bosom of fools." &mdash; Ecclesiastes 7:9

> “How much more grievous are the consequences of anger than the causes of it.” &mdash; Marcus Aurelius, Meditations  -->

- **`Argumentum ad verecundiam:`** An `appeal to authority` is where an assertion is deemed true because of the position or authority of the person asserting it. Subtypes of `ad verecundiam` include: Appeal to accomplishment & Courtier's reply.

    - I think the best example of this is the `Courtier's reply` (a criticism is dismissed by claiming that the critic lacks sufficient knowledge, credentials, or training to credibly comment on the subject matter.
 
        Simply, if someone attacks your "lack of credentials" or credibility instead of focusing on the argument, they have lost the debate. You could also apply ad verecundiam to people who assert that they are right because they are older and "know better". *To whom it may concern, I did not use this on you, I was referring to my older age as having given me memories of a time since past, but I think it was misconstrued. Apologies for lack of clarification.*

- **`Argumentum ad crumenam:`** An `appeal to wealth` also known as an `argument to the purse`, is the informal fallacy of concluding that a statement is incorrect because the speaker is poor, or that a statement is correct because the speaker is rich. 

    - An example might be: "If you're so smart, why aren't you rich?"
    
        This type of conclusion is an error in logic. Essentially, nothing is "above your pay-grade". No matter your tax bracket, the merits of your argument should be taken seriously. 

- **`Argumentum ad populum:`** An `appeal to the majority`, is a proposition that is claimed to be true or good solely because a majority or many people believe it to be so. This is also known as: the bandwagon argument.

    - I think Einstein said it best when he said:
        > “What is right is not always popular and what is popular is not always right.” &mdash; Albert Einstein 

- **`Straw man fallacy:`** Last but not least, misrepresenting an opponent's argument by broadening or narrowing the scope of a premise and/or refuting a weaker version of their argument.

<!-- - This form of misrepresentation is used a lot by the cults, especially in the witness organization. One example would be when they claim that Christians believe in a "three headed God," referring to the Trinity, when this has never been a held belief of any follower of Christ. From the early church fathers on down to present day, Christians have said and taught the same thing that Christ and the Apostles taught, that there is only one God in three personages.

    Nevertheless, they continue to misrepresent what Christ, the Apostles, and all Christians have taught and believed from the very beginning, in order to strengthen their false argument.
    
    It's ironic that they continue with this line of erroneous thinking, when it was their very organization that has divided the one God into multiple individual gods (see John 1:1-3,14 they added the letter 'a' which doesn't appear in the greek essentially splitting Jesus & God into two) -->



## **Dealing With Vicious Ad Hominem and Slander**

<!-- There are three ways I respond to slander, each of these ways usually end up with me ignoring or not associating with aforementioned provocateur. First realize that those who malign others are projecting their own insecurities and limitations upon those they envy. There is really no other reason for a person to behave in such a manner unless they're acting on envy or out of ignorance. -->

# The Christian Method

> "Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light." &mdash; Jesus, Matthew 11:28-30

Imagine, for a moment, the perfect transcendental infinite God beyond the spatiotemporal limitations of human understanding. A perfect representation of [agape](https://biblehub.com/greek/26.htm) love (1 Jn 4:8) who was made manifest in the flesh (Jn 1:1-3,14) to give his life as a ransom for the sins of the world (Ro 3:23, 1 Ti 2:6, Mt 20:28, Mk 10:45).

<!-- > The one who does not love [[ἀγαπῶν]](https://biblehub.com/greek/25.htm) does not know God, for God is love [[ἀγάπη]](https://biblehub.com/greek/26.htm). &mdash; 1 John 4:8, on agape love -->

<!-- The more thought you put into it the more you would realize that what you were imagining already existed in the person of Christ. -->

Now imagine the reaction of this pure, holy, and limitless God, as he watches the depravity of mankind unfold over time. Kingdoms rise and fall, wars are waged, and peace comes and goes, murders are committed, rape, infidelities, scams, corrupt pastors (Je 23:1-3), hypocrites (Titus 1:16, 1 Jn 4:8, Re 2:4-5), hatred (1 John 3:15), and slander. Let's compare and contrast God with the enemy of mankind.

> “... When God became a man Himself, the experience proved to be nothing short of pure agony. In man’s time-honored fashion, they would unleash the whole arsenal of weapons against Him: **misrepresentation, slander, and accusation of treason**. The stage was set for a situation without parallel in the history of the earth. God would visit creatures and they would nail Him to the cross!” &mdash; Werner von Braun, the father of space science

Does it really come as a surprise to anyone that he might be disgusted? Let's take a closer look at slander. First understand that God righteously hates this behavior, so much that he refers to it as an abomination. An abomination is something that causes hate or disgust. In biblical usage, an abomination is something that God loathes or hates because it is offensive to Him and His character. 


<!-- This is why I have adopted the stance that there is no such thing as a stupid person, only stupid decisions. -->

> There are six things which Yahweh hates, Even seven **which are an abomination to Him**: Haughty eyes, **a lying tongue**, And hands that shed innocent blood, A heart that devises wicked thoughts, Feet that hasten to run to evil, **A false witness who breathes out lies, And one who spreads strife among brothers.** &mdash; Proverbs 6:16-19

<!-- > But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, ‘You fool!’ will be liable to the hell of fire. &mdash; Matthew 5:22 -->

# The Stoic Method

<!-- <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R9OCA6UFE-0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> -->

Stoicism is an good way to handle the vicissitudes of life. Remaining equanimous in the face of evil is a skill known only to silver men.

<!-- > "Say to yourself first thing in the morning: today I shall meet people who are meddling, ungrateful, aggressive, treacherous, malicious, unsocial. All this has afflicted them through their ignorance of true good and evil." &mdash; Emperor Marcus Aurelius' Meditations, Chapter 2. Written among the Quadi on the River Gran -->

> “When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. They are like this because they can't tell good from evil." &mdash; Emperor Marcus Aurelius' Meditations, Chapter 2. Written among the Quadi on the River Gran (Translation by Gregory Hays)

One way to deal with people like this, is not with immaturity, but with stoicism and equanimity. I am reminded of the wise words of Lucius Annaeus Seneca the Younger in De Tranquillitate Animi ([On the Tranquility of the Mind](https://youtu.be/vl5WDfwY4PY?t=1032)) in his ninth book of the dialogues:

> "hence comes the State of Mind of those who loathe their idleness complain that they have nothing to do and view the progress of others with the bitterest jealousy for an unhappy sloth favours the growth of envy and those who cannot succeed themselves wish everyone else to be ruined."

Epictetus is another stoic philosopher that will help you deal with vicious attacks from others.

> “The key is to keep company only with people who uplift you, whose presence calls forth your best.” &mdash; Epictetus

Epictetus reminds us that sometimes the most appropriate response is simply to laugh to oneself. A provocateur cannot truly know who you are can they? 

<!-- So, then they are assuming, essentially playing God, and in their hubris they have become a fool worthy of ridicule and scorn. -->

> “I laugh at those who think they can damage me. They do not know who I am, they do not know what I think, they cannot even touch the things which are really mine and with which I live.” &mdash; Epictetus

<!-- say nothing -->

# The Philosophical Taoist Method

The best translation of the Tao Te Ching is by far the one translated by [Gia-Fu Feng](https://eheart.com/TAO/TTC/TTCchapters-small.pdf).

> Yield and overcome;<br>
Bend and be straight;<br>
Empty and be full;<br>
Wear out and be new;<br>
Have little and gain;<br>
Have much and be confused.<br>
>
Therefore the wise embrace the one<br>
And set an example to all.<br>
Not putting on a display,<br>
They shine forth.<br>
Not justifying themselves,<br>
They are distinguished.<br>
Not boasting,<br>
They receive recognition.<br>
Not bragging,<br>
They never falter.<br>
**They do not quarrel,**<br>
**So no one quarrels with them.**<br>
Therefore the ancients say, “Yield and overcome.”<br>
Is that an empty saying?<br>
Be truly whole,<br>
And all things will come to you.<br>
>
&mdash; Tao Te Ching, Twenty Two

<!-- ## ****

> Ninth. Kindness is invincible - if it is sincere, not fawning or 9
pretence. What can the most aggressive man do to you if you
continue to be kind to him? If, as opportunity arises, you gently
admonish him and take your time to re-educate him at the very
moment when he is trying to do you harm? 'No, son, we were
born for other purposes than this. There is no way that I can
be harmed, but you are harming yourself, son.' And show him
delicately how things are, making the general point that bees
do not act like this, or any other creatures of gregarious nature.
But your advice must not be ironic or critical. It should be
affectionate, with no hurt feelings, not a lecture or a demonstration to impress others, but the way you would talk to
someone by himself irrespective of company. -->


## **Wise Words From The Book Theaetetus**

> "Only I beg that you will observe this condition: do not be unjust in your questions. It is the height of unreasonableness that a person who professes to care for moral goodness should
be consistently unjust in discussion. I mean by injustice, in this connection,
the behavior of a man who does not take care to keep controversy distinct
from discussion; a man who forgets that in controversy he may play about
and trip up his opponent as often as he can, but that **in discussion he must be serious, he must keep on helping his opponent to his feet again, and point out to him only those of his slips which are due to himself or to the intellectual society which he has previously frequented**. If you observe this distinction, those who associate with you will blame themselves for their confusion and their difficulties, not you. They will seek your company,
and think of you as their friend; but they will loathe themselves, and seek
refuge from themselves in philosophy, in the hope that they may thereby
become different people and be rid forever of the men that they once were.
But if you follow the common practice and do the opposite, you will get the opposite results. Instead of philosophers, you will make your companions grow up to be the enemies of philosophy.
>
‘So, if you take my advice, as I said before, you will sit down with us
without ill will or hostility, in a kindly spirit. You will genuinely try to
find out what our meaning is when we maintain that all things are in
motion and that for each person and each city, things are what they seem
to them to be. And upon this basis you will inquire whether knowledge and
perception are the same thing or different things. But you will not proceed
as you did just now. You will not base your argument upon the use and
wont of language; you will not follow the practice of most men, who drag words this way and that at their pleasure, so making every imaginable
difficulty for one another.'" &mdash; Socrates (Plato)
